		I really enjoy living in Austin, but one day I hope to be able to live in New York. It has always been my dream to attend college and stay over there for a while to experience the New York life. My favorite thing to do is read and spend time with friends and Family. Although, my favorite person to spend time with isn't a person as it's my dog Benny. I love going outside and reading while he plays.
	<h2>My Favorite Things</h2>
		<h3>My Favorite Movie</h3>
		My favorite movie is <em> The Invitation</em> it was released on August 26, 2022. The lead actor is <em>Nathalie Emmanuel</em> she is a new up-coming actort that hasn't been in anything too known. I really enjoyed that it was a different type of scary movie and not just the regular demons or ghost, but it was about vampires and they found a way to makes it scary. My favorite scene was when she finds out that her love intrest is a Vampire, the emotion that is shown in her eyes was amazing.
		<h3>My Favorite Foods</h3>
		Pizza, Tinga, and Tacos.
